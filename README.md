# sucre
yet another gif tool (this one is better tho)  

a fork of vanille that is a lot more lightweight and modular than vanille itself  

sucre is a fully standalone script that will convert any input video you drag and drop on the script file into a gif with pretty good quality 
however unlike vanille sucre is entirely self contained thus every feature vanille had (seek, profiles, optimisation, ytdl) is now optional  
to get those features u just need to follow this folder structure  

sucre.bat  
runes    
-script.bat  
-script.bat  
-script.bat  
-etc...  

so far only seek is available but i am working on the ytdl script and it will be usable along with seek  

### requirements
ffmpeg  
ffprobe  
gifski  

### optional
youtube-dl

### faq
> why does it remove the video after the gif is done?

the goal of this script is to make gifs not to be a youtube dl downloader, if u want smth like that feel free to take a look at heyam on my github which does exactly that  

> why are scripts called "runes"?

if u know u know  

> why batch?

no
